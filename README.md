# ChattClient
(Looking for ChattServer? You're in the wrong place, bud.)

Don't want to get tracked, spied, or even banned on the entire platform for breaking the platform's rules?\
We've got you covered.

ChattClient is a chat client that joins ChattServers. No need for being extra careful for privacy-- the Chatt Platform will never, ever, spy up on you.

## Disclaimer
1. This product **IS NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER CHAT CLIENTS/SERVERS**;
   this product **must** be used as a _secondary_ chat client.
2. As Chatt products do _not_ have a TOS against bad usage of the product (other than hacking other users),
   many people _may_ do the following, but not limited to:
    - Engaging in hate speech or discriminatory behavior.
    - Sharing or promoting explicit or illegal content.
    - Harassing or stalking other users.
    - Engaging in fraudulent activities or scams.
    - Violating intellectual property rights by sharing copyrighted material without permission.
    - Spreading misinformation or engaging in disinformation campaigns.
    - Engaging in cyberbullying or online harassment.
    - Invading others' privacy by sharing personal information without consent.
    - Promoting or organizing illegal activities, such as drug trafficking or terrorism.
3. ChattServer does **NOT** log messages, neither in console nor log files, sent by players;
   this is considered to be telemetry and we want Chatt products to be privacy-focused.
   Consider joining the server itself.

## How to use
Provided that you understand the risks provided in the disclaimer,
here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the client yourself:
